 * Implementation of Reader that wraps underlying Reader, but forces Reader.read(...) to read at most 1 character.
 * This makes it useful for exposing the case when a 'some input' is available, but not enough to fill the supplied buffer.
 * It's expected of the Reader's consumer to keep calling read, until the supplied buffer is filled.
